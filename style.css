/*
This theme does not load the style.css, it loads a minified CSS that is created
by SASS.  The SASS files are found in the sass directory. 

It uses Gulp to convert the SASS files to CSS and then minify them.  

To install gulp and all the packages necessary, install npm 
https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
and then go to the root of this theme and run

npm install

once installed run 'gulp' from the command line and leave it alone.  it will 
automatically minify a new version of the CSS on every change you make. 

However.....

Its better in many cases to make a child theme and do adaptions in there.
