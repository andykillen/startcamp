## Why should it be used

Many WordCamps tend to have a poorly made theme, and this is a travesty.  We, the WordPress community deserve better. 
So, to help this process.  

This is the basis where you can grow from.  It takes care of most things, leaving you to add your polish on top. 

It was intended that you can use this in 1 of 2 ways.  

1. Take this theme and hack it to death to make your own thing.  
2. Make a child theme and override or add to the functionality inside here. 

## Whats missing

There is **no e-commerce element for selling tickets**.  This was done on purpose.
You the leader of your WordCamp should choose your own ecommerce solution, and implement and test it.

Perhaps you want to have multi-ticket discount, or only buy one ticket per person? Maybe you want to use Stripe, 
maybe paypal, or maybe bitcoin? 

## How to configure

1. Download the theme into the /wp-content/themes directory
2. In the admin screen enable the theme
3. Go to the customizer and enter the details in the startcamp section
4. Implement your own ticket sales 
5. Smile as you are done!

## Adding to this project

For e-commerce solutions, please make a plugin, share it with me and I will add it on this readme. Lets keep the theme clean.

For all other things, fork it and make a PR.  :)  we all benefit.
